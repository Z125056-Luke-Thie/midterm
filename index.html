                        <p>I make all my pages out of rows, each piece of content is a new "row" which is then with PhP required on the correct webpage. This makes having just 1 header and footer much easier, and you can recycle content where necessary.</p>
                        <p>Besides the blueprint, I try to make all my web-projects to be handbuild, and not to be constrained by any frameworks.</p>

As the name implies, I make all my stuff custom, that is also why I don't make use of any frameworks. I put a lot of thought and time into designing and making my own website, from a very fancy banner with flickering neon lights to the contact form that is reCaptcha V4 secured, and even the header didn't go untouched. Check it out at digitalcustoms.nl</p>
                    <p id="project-text-kahoot" class="item-hidden" style="display: none">For my class called Webdesign & Programming of my semester Study abroad at Shibaura Institute of Technology, we had an assignment to make a quiz application. The questions together with answers where given in the form of a Json file. We than had to, with the given code, make a quiz application. I ofcourse took it to far, and made the whole thing, except for the questions totally custom and took inspiration from the very populair quiz application, called Kahoot. My questionaire also has a timer in the form, it generates and keep track of your score, which is calculated by the amount of miliseconds you had left per question.</p>
                    <p id="project-text-hotwheels_db" class="item-hidden" style="display: none">A few years ago, I started collecting HotWheels, just the ones which I though where cool as a car enthousiast. My Girlfriend started filmming me looking for HotWheels, and put these videos on TikTok. The video's became that populair, that we got questions if we also sold them. From that point on, I have started to make my own application in which I can keep track of all the models I already have, and will soon also serve as my own selling platform.</p>
                    <p id="project-text-v_tt" class="item-hidden" style="display: none">I found this client while staying with my parents in law on the camping, he was our neighbore. We started talking and eventually, we made arrangements to meet up, after the vacation. One thing lead to another, and I made him a complete custom website. I wasn't much of a designer then, which is noticable. But I did implement some minor fancy things, like a menu inside of a menu.</p>

But since I have met one of my best friends which was about 5 years ago, he has dragged me into the Honda world, and I have worked on my own car ever since, from bumper to bumper. In the pictures below you see my very own Honda CR-Z, which ones was a factory car, now has been fitted with many mods, like Renault Clio RS brake calipers, a custom made turbo kit, you name it.</p>

And at some point like15 years ago already, I was introduced into DJ'ing, I still remember having this very simplistic DJ controller. From that point on, I have had training and trained myself to become a better DJ every time. I have done several gigs now, and I just can't stop wanting to perform as DJ Dumpling.</p>

                            <p>Besides cars and music, I am a sucker for a good and intriguing story. When the Nintendo DS Light, was still a thing, I played Professor Layton, a story telling puzzle game, that gave me the love for puzzles (not the jigsaw kind). Another game that has influenced me is of course Need For Speed, together with my love for cars, I don't think it needs an explanation. One last game I'd like to mention, which I think didn't get enough attention, is Observer. Look it up if you're interested.</p>
